\subsection{Test Configuration}

DEF is designed to be transparently compatible with C in that C header files can be included in DEF, and the utility \texttt{defghi} (DEF Generate Headers and Interfaces), can take DEF source files and emit C header files for inclusion in C.  This makes it easy to correct for any variation created by the benchmark driver or the allocator.
