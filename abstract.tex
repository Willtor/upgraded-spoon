The unfortunate state of the art for implementing industrial concurrent data structures in high performance languages like C and C++ involves reinventing the wheel on each structure, where the wheel is memory reclamation. In academic papers we simply let the memory leak. We introduce DEF, a programming language designed as a supplement or drop-in replacement for C, but with facilities for building high performance concurrent data structures.  DEF supports, but does not require, a highly efficient automatic memory reclamation system that fits with the C philosophy: track only memory the programmer specifies and make your own choice of allocator. It inter-operates seamlessly with C, or any language that has C hooks, granting programmers the flexibility to apply as much or as little DEF as they choose in their applications. We demonstrate its efficacy by showing how a collection of concurrent data structures, previously available only with memory leaks, can be implemented with full memory reclamation almost without change and with the same performance guarantees. We believe using DEF will open new pathways to the development and acceptance of high performance data structures for a wide range of applications.
