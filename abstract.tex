The exclusive choice between concurrency and high performance on a single core is not inherent in software development.  High performance programming languages, like C and C++, eschew garbage collectors in favor of manual memory management.  When applied to concurrent data structures this creates friction between simple, maintainable code that leaks, and code that's complex and difficult to maintain but doesn't leak.  Benchmark programmers prefer the former since leaking memory is considered acceptable in practice.  Application programmers must choose the latter since leaking memory is unacceptable.  We introduce DEF, a programming language that provides a third option: code that is both simple and maintainable, and safely reclaims memory from concurrent data structures.  DEF is ``close to the machine'' like C, allowing programmers to performance engineer their code, but provides native support for memory reclamation using Forkscan.
