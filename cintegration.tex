Language designers and maintainers commonly provide support and documentation for how to integrate C modules into projects based in their languages.  Of the top ten most popular languages by pull request on Github\cite{Octoverse}, nine have native support for calling C code\cite{JavascriptCiface}\cite{PythonCiface}\cite{JavaCiface}\cite{RubyCiface}\cite{PHPCiface}\cite{DotNetCiface}\cite{GoCiface}(cite C++) (the exception, CSS; C, in tenth place, obviously links with itself).

The benefits of C integration are numerous: The major computer operating systems are written in C,(cite) the C runtime is ubiquitous and generally doesn't conflict with other language runtimes, and C is conducive to high performance programming.
